### Refleksi Commit 1
In this commit I wrote (or rather copied) my first rust code. It looks familiar, we have the semocolons, curly-brackets for-loops, import statements. But there are some new things that makes it somewhat unique. Since I mostly copied the code in the module, understanding it might be later in the agenda. The rudimentary web server has a very familiar setup as well

In this commit, I added a simple landing page to the webserver. The landing page is a simple HTML page with a title and a paragraph. The page is served at the root of the server. The code is simple and easy to understand. The code is also well commented, making it easy to understand what each part of the code does. But I dont like how there will be a bunch of html files just for the sake of serving a page.

Followed the link given on how to route for unknown pages. Pretty standard procedure for a 404 page. The book is easy to follow. I'm starting to get a feel of the syntax and feel of rust. The code is simple and easy to understand, making it easy to follow the flow of the code. there are also some refactoring happening.

### Refleksi Commit 4
There is little to reflect here. Just copy pasting another sample of code. Did the thing where I open 2 browser windows and indeed it was slow. It's pretty obvious it has something to do with single threading.
