### Refleksi Commit 1
In this commit I wrote (or rather copied) my first rust code. It looks familiar, we have the semocolons, curly-brackets for-loops, import statements, but there are some new things that makes it somewhat unique. Since I mostly copied the code in the module, understanding it might be later in the agenda. The rudimentary web server has a very familiar setup as well
